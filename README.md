# Image-Based Visual Servoing for Drones

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for implementing Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) for drones. Image-Based Visual Servoing is a technique that utilizes visual feedback from onboard cameras to control the motion of a drone. This repository provides a simple and modular implementation with IBVS for drone applications.
